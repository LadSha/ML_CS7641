Instruction to run code:
- The file containing the code for each algorithm and dataset is labeled accordingly. For instance, DT_Dataset1 indicates Decision Tree model for dataset 1. The same applies to DT_Dataset2.
- The function "experiment" in each file will run all the experiments performed for the associated model and dataset.
- Compare.py runs the tuned models for both datasets. The functions "first_dataset" and "second_dataset" will generate a table showing the results of models on the test datasets. 
- requirements.txt file provides all the required libraries for the code.
